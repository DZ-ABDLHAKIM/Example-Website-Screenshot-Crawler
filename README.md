# Website Screenshot Crawler

A template for automated website screenshot capturing. This actor takes screenshots of websites from specified URLs, uploads them to Apify Key-Value Store, and provides screenshot URLs in a dataset. It is ideal for monitoring website changes, archiving web content, or capturing visuals for reports. The actor uses [Pyppeteer](https://pyppeteer.github.io/pyppeteer/) for browser automation and screenshot generation.

## Included Features

- **[Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/)** - A toolkit for building Apify Actors and scrapers in Python.
- **[Pyppeteer](https://pyppeteer.github.io/pyppeteer/)** - A Python port of Puppeteer, an open-source tool for automating web browsers using a high-level API.
- **[Key-Value Store](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/docs/concepts/storages#working-with-key-value-stores)** - Store screenshots and metadata for easy retrieval.
- **[Dataset](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/docs/concepts/storages#working-with-datasets)** - Structured storage for results like screenshot URLs and metadata.
- **Cookie and Viewport Support** - Allows setting cookies and specifying the viewport dimensions before capturing screenshots.

## Input

The input for this actor should be JSON containing the necessary configuration. The only required field is `link_urls`, which must be an array of website URLs. All other fields are optional. Hereâ€™s a detailed description of the input fields:

## Output

Once the actor finishes executing, it will output a screenshot of each website into a file stored in the Key-Value Store associated with the run. The screenshot URLs will also be stored in a dataset for easy access.

## How It Works

1. **Input Configuration**: The actor reads the input data as specified above.
2. **Browser Automation**: The actor launches a headless browser using Pyppeteer, loading the target URLs, and capturing screenshots.
3. **Setting Cookies and Viewport**: Before navigating to each link, specified cookies are set using `page.setCookie()`, and the viewport is configured with specified width and height.
4. **Page Navigation**: The actor navigates to each URL using `page.goto()`, waiting for the specified `waitUntil` event.
5. **Scrolling (Optional)**: If the `scrollToBottom` option is enabled, the actor executes a scrolling script that scrolls down the page by the defined `distance` in pixels.
6. **Screenshot Capture**: After the page has fully loaded, the actor waits for the `Sleep` duration before capturing the screenshot and saves it with a random filename.
7. **Uploading Screenshots**: The captured screenshots are read as binary data and uploaded to the Apify Key-Value Store using `Actor.set_value()`, with URLs stored in the dataset.
8. **Logging and Error Handling**: The actor logs the success or failure of each URL processed, ensuring that it can continue processing even if one fails.
9. **Cleanup**: After processing all URLs, the actor closes the browser.

This open-source actor effectively automates the process of capturing and storing screenshots of multiple web pages, making it a valuable tool for monitoring website changes, archiving content, or generating visual reports.
